# looney
I was recently using Plex to organize my media collection, and I noticed that
my copy of "Looney Tunes Golden Collection" wasn't being processed very well.

I checked how Plex scans tv shows, and discovered it used
[TheTVDB](http://thetvdb.com/) to do it's magic. After diving into the forums
I found the [related post](https://forums.thetvdb.com/viewtopic.php?t=11566)
which mentioned my issue.

The solution was immediately clear, I needed to convert my files into the
global format so that I could enjoy my cartoons from anywhere. So was born,
Looney.
